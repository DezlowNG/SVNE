# SVNE - Simple Visual Novel Engine written in C++

The main goal of the engine is to provide a fast and simple platform on which anyone can create a **non-commercial/commercial** visual novel without programming knowledge.

In order to start creating your own visual novel, you must have any text editor installed (Notepad ++, Atom, VSC and others).

If you already have a text editor installed, go to [wiki](https://github.com/DezlowNG/SVNE/wiki).
